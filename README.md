**FlowChef** introduces a novel approach to steer the rectified flow models (RFMs)  for controlled image generation for inversion-free, gradient-free, and training-free navigation of denoising trajectories. Unlike diffusion models, which demand extensive training and computational resources, **FlowChef** unifies tasks like **classifier guidance, inverse problems, and image editing** without extra training or backpropagation. **FlowChef** sets new benchmarks in performance, memory, and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results.

***We extend the FlowChef on Flux.1[dev] for image editing and inverse problems.*** 



## ðŸ”¥ Updates

- **[2025.03.15]** Scripts for gradio demo are provided in this repo.
- **[2024.11.29]**  All working demos are released on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/FlowChef)!

## TODOs

- [ ] Extend the FlowChef to the video models.
- [ ] (top-priority) Release the support for [Inductive Moment Matching](https://github.com/lumalabs/imm) for inverse problems.
- [ ] (top-priority) Release the latent-space inverse problem benchmark script (with baselines).
- [ ] Release the diffusion baselines.
- ~~[x] Release the pixel-space inverse problem benchmark script (with baselines)~~
- ~~[x] Release the organized demo scripts~~
- ~~[x] Release the Flux.1[dev] demo~~
- ~~[x] Release the InstaFlow demo~~

## Instructions for `gradio_demos`

This folder contains all the gradio demos on Flux and InstaFLow. 
We provide Editing and Inpainting (Inverse Problem Setting) using FlowChef.

To set up the conda environment for the `gradio_demos` project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
# alternatively manually download the codebase
git clone https://github.com/FlowChef/FlowChef.git

cd FlowChef/demos

# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name flowchef_env python=3.10 -y

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate flowchef_env

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By following these steps, you will have a conda environment set up and ready to run the `demos`.

### **Running the Gradio Demos**

Once the environment is set up, you can run the following demos:

1. **Flux Editing and Inpainting (Inverse Problem):**

    ```bash
    gradio app_flux.py
    ```

2. **InstaFlow Editing:**

    ```bash
    gradio app_instaflow_edit.py
    ```

3. **InstaFlow Inpainting (Inverse Problem):**

    ```bash
    gradio app_instaflow_ip_inpaint.py
    ```


## Instructions for `inverseproblems/pixel_models/rfpp`

This folder contains the code for solving inverse problems using RF++ models. We provide scripts for various baselines and our FlowChef approach.

For detailed instructions on:
- Setting up pretrained checkpoints
- Downloading test datasets 
- Running inference for different inverse problems (box inpainting, super resolution, deblurring)
- Evaluating baselines (DFlow, OTODE, DPS, FreeDoM) and FlowChef

Please refer to the detailed README in the [`inverseproblems/pixel_models/rfpp`](inverseproblems/pixel_models/rfpp/README.md) directory.

Note: The current implementation supports AFHQ-Cat and CelebA datasets. Support for ImageNet and higher resolutions (up to 256x256) will be released soon. Alternatively for these use cases, please check our latent model solutions.
