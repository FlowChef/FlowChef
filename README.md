**FlowChef** introduces a novel approach to steer the rectified flow models (RFMs)  for controlled image generation for inversion-free, gradient-free, and training-free navigation of denoising trajectories. Unlike diffusion models, which demand extensive training and computational resources, **FlowChef** unifies tasks like **classifier guidance, inverse problems, and image editing** without extra training or backpropagation. **FlowChef** sets new benchmarks in performance, memory, and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results.

***We extend the FlowChef on Flux.1[dev] for image editing and inverse problems.***
